# Advanced Consistency Checking Improvements

## Current Limitations

Your existing consistency checker has these limitations:
1. **Pattern matching only**: Relies on keyword searches
2. **No semantic understanding**: Misses deeper context
3. **Limited learning**: Can't improve over time
4. **Brittle parsing**: Hardcoded rules and patterns
5. **Shallow analysis**: Surface-level checks only

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. **Semantic Embeddings Analysis**
```typescript
// Use vector embeddings to understand meaning, not just keywords
async generateSemanticEmbedding(text: string): Promise<number[]>
async compareSemanticSimilarity(text1: string, text2: string): Promise<number>
```

**Benefits:**
- Understands meaning beyond keywords
- Detects subtle inconsistencies
- Works across languages and writing styles

### 2. **Character Behavioral Profiles**
```typescript
interface CharacterProfile {
  personalityEmbeddings: number[][];
  speechPatterns: SemanticPattern[];
  behaviorHistory: ActionPattern[];
  emotionalBaseline: EmotionalState;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Tracks character evolution over time
- Detects personality drift
- Identifies out-of-character behavior

### 3. **Graph-Based Narrative Analysis**
```typescript
interface NarrativeGraph {
  nodes: Map<string, NarrativeNode>;
  edges: Map<string, NarrativeEdge>;
  timelineConnections: TemporalEdge[];
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Models complex relationships
- Tracks plot thread dependencies
- Identifies narrative dead ends

### 4. **Multi-Modal AI Analysis**
```typescript
// Different AI perspectives on the same content
async analyzeFromMultiplePerspectives(chapter: Chapter): Promise<{
  psychologicalConsistency: ConsistencyIssue[];
  narrativeFlow: ConsistencyIssue[];
  emotionalTone: ConsistencyIssue[];
  worldBuildingLogic: ConsistencyIssue[];
}>
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches issues from multiple angles
- Reduces false positives
- More comprehensive analysis

### 5. **Statistical Pattern Recognition**
```typescript
interface StatisticalAnalysis {
  characterAppearancePatterns: Map<string, number[]>;
  dialogueLengthDistribution: number[];
  plotAdvancementRate: number;
  anomalyDetection: AnomalyScore[];
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Identifies unusual patterns
- Detects pacing issues
- Flags statistical anomalies

### 6. **Learning and Adaptation**
```typescript
interface LearningSystem {
  userFeedback: FeedbackData[];
  patternWeights: Map<string, number>;
  adaptiveThresholds: ThresholdMap;
  improvementHistory: LearningMetrics[];
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Improves over time
- Learns from user corrections
- Personalizes to writing style

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhanced AI Analysis (Immediate)
1. **Better Prompting**: Use structured prompts with specific focus areas
2. **Multi-perspective analysis**: Run different types of analysis in parallel
3. **Improved parsing**: Better extraction of AI responses

### Phase 2: Semantic Understanding (Medium-term)
1. **Character profiling**: Build comprehensive character behavioral models
2. **Contextual analysis**: Understand deeper narrative context
3. **Relationship modeling**: Track character dynamics over time

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Long-term)
1. **Statistical analysis**: Pattern recognition and anomaly detection
2. **Learning system**: Adaptive improvement based on feedback
3. **Predictive analysis**: Forecast potential consistency issues

## Quick Wins You Can Implement Now

### 1. **Improved AI Prompts**
```typescript
const ADVANCED_CONSISTENCY_PROMPTS = {
  characterPsychology: `
    Analyze character psychological consistency:
    - Internal motivations vs external actions
    - Emotional response appropriateness
    - Decision-making patterns
    - Character growth trajectory
  `,
  narrativeFlow: `
    Analyze narrative flow and logic:
    - Event causality chains
    - Information revelation timing
    - Tension building patterns
    - Scene transition smoothness
  `,
  worldBuilding: `
    Analyze world-building consistency:
    - Rule adherence
    - Internal logic
    - Consequence consistency
    - System interactions
  `
};
```

### 2. **Context-Aware Analysis**
```typescript
// Instead of simple keyword matching
async analyzeCharacterInContext(
  character: Character,
  currentChapter: Chapter,
  previousChapters: Chapter[],
  characterHistory: CharacterAppearance[]
): Promise<ConsistencyIssue[]>
```

### 3. **Parallel Analysis**
```typescript
// Run multiple analyses simultaneously
const [
  psychologyIssues,
  narrativeIssues,
  worldBuildingIssues,
  emotionalIssues
] = await Promise.all([
  analyzeCharacterPsychology(chapter),
  analyzeNarrativeFlow(chapter),
  analyzeWorldBuilding(chapter),
  analyzeEmotionalConsistency(chapter)
]);
```

## Example: Enhanced Character Analysis

```typescript
async analyzeCharacterAdvanced(character: Character, chapter: Chapter): Promise<ConsistencyIssue[]> {
  const issues: ConsistencyIssue[] = [];
  
  // 1. Semantic analysis of character actions
  const actions = extractCharacterActions(chapter.content, character.name);
  const personalityEmbedding = await generateEmbedding(character.personality);
  
  for (const action of actions) {
    const actionEmbedding = await generateEmbedding(action);
    const similarity = cosineSimilarity(personalityEmbedding, actionEmbedding);
    
    if (similarity < CONSISTENCY_THRESHOLD) {
      issues.push({
        type: 'character',
        severity: 'medium',
        description: `Character action "${action}" seems inconsistent with personality`,
        suggestion: 'Review action against established character traits'
      });
    }
  }
  
  // 2. Dialogue pattern analysis
  const dialogues = extractCharacterDialogue(chapter.content, character.name);
  const speechPatterns = await analyzeDialoguePatterns(dialogues);
  
  if (speechPatterns.formalityDrift > FORMALITY_THRESHOLD) {
    issues.push({
      type: 'character',
      severity: 'low',
      description: 'Character speech formality has changed significantly',
      suggestion: 'Ensure consistent speech patterns or show character development'
    });
  }
  
  // 3. Relationship consistency
  const relationships = extractCharacterRelationships(chapter.content, character.name);
  const relationshipIssues = await analyzeRelationshipConsistency(relationships);
  issues.push(...relationshipIssues);
  
  return issues;
}
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Caching**: Store embeddings and analysis results
2. **Batch processing**: Process multiple chapters together
3. **Parallel execution**: Run analyses simultaneously
4. **Progressive enhancement**: Start with basic checks, add advanced ones

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to measure improvement:
- **Detection rate**: Percentage of actual issues caught
- **False positive rate**: Percentage of flagged non-issues
- **User satisfaction**: Feedback on suggestion quality
- **Time savings**: Reduction in manual review time

## Next Steps

1. **Implement improved AI prompts** (1-2 days)
2. **Add context-aware analysis** (1 week)
3. **Build character profiling system** (2-3 weeks)
4. **Add statistical analysis** (1 month)
5. **Implement learning system** (2-3 months)

This approach will give you much more sophisticated consistency checking that actually understands your content rather than just matching patterns.
